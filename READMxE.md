# Java TDD Challenge

This is a small exercise to practice TDD in Java.
To participate, please follow these simple steps:

## 1) Fork this repository.

* You need to be logged-in with your Github account.
* Click the "Fork" button in the upper right!
* In your [repository's settings](/../../settings), enable issue tracking.

## 2) Set-up Travis CI for your fork

* Log-in to [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) and
* Enable automatic builds for your exercise repository.

## 3) Dive into the code

* Clone the repository on your computer!
* **You are not allowed to modify any code files**
  * except in the package `phones.impl`
  * and in the test folder,
  * or if otherwise noted.
* Try to get all tests green!
  * Preferably, not by deleting the tests. There is no one to cheat but yourself!

## 4) Commit and push

* When you are done, push your changes.
* Travis CI will now try to build your project.

## 5) Check your inbox

* You will be notified of problems via Github issues.
* While you wait, see if your code can use some refactorings.

## 6) Repeat steps 3 to 5 until no more issues are posted

* The end is a bit anti-climatic. Sorry for that!
